**studying bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.**

In my project, I used (Regression) to predict the number of bike rentals hourly or daily based on environmental and seasonal settings      
And most importantly! To reveal events in a specific city where
The number of rental bikes is also linked to some events in the city which can be easily tracked via search engines.
For example, a query like "2012-10-30 in towndown." Therefore, the data can be used to validate case and event detection algorithms as well

>Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of 
over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues.of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
